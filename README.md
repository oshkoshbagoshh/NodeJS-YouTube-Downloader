# AJ's Simple Node JS YouTube Downloader

## Description
This is a simple node JavaScript CLI program that asks the user to input the URL for the YouTube Video(no audio) they want to download.

It then downloads to the users ~/Downloads folder with the file name of the YouTube Video as an mp4 file.

Additional features will be coming in the near future (such as a GUI, audio, etc.)

## Code Used:

```javascript

const fs = require('fs');
const ytdl = require('ytdl-core');
const path = require('path');
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')({ sigint: true });

// Ask the user for the YouTube video URL
const videoUrl = prompt('Enter the YouTube video URL you want to download: ');

// Verify the URL
if (!ytdl.validateURL(videoUrl)) {
  console.error('The URL provided is not a valid YouTube video URL.');
  process.exit(1);
}

// Set the output directory to the user's downloads folder
const outputDirectory = path.join(require('os').homedir(), 'Downloads');
const outputFilename = 'video.mp4'; // You could use ytdl to get the title and make a filename from it
const outputPath = path.join(outputDirectory, outputFilename);

try {
  ytdl(videoUrl)
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(outputPath))
    .on('finish', () => {
      console.log(`The video has been downloaded and saved to ${outputPath}`);
    })
    .on('error', (error) => {
